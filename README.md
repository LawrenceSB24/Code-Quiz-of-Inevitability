# Code-Quiz-of-Inevitability

## Introduction

Good day. tonight we are tackling how to implement a code quiz using web apis. 

## User Story
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
## Status
Ok, so one thing you will notice of the bat is that there is not display for the user score. I am still currently working on this and should have it fixed soon. Also a video demonstration will be included in the descriptiton.
